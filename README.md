# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edi, a passionate beginner in the world of technology and software development. This is my GitHub profile where I'm starting my journey in open source and coding.

## About Me

I'm eager to learn and grow in the field of  web development,software development. My GitHub profile is a work in progress, and you'll find a couple of projects I've started to explore my interests.

## Projects

Here are the projects I'm currently working on:

1. **[TIC TAC TOE-GAME]**:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as X and O, is a simple yet fun project that I've created to delve into game development and user interaction. It's a classic two-player strategy game where the goal is to complete a line, column, or diagonal with your symbol (X or O). It has been a great learning experience in GUI development and game logic.

2. **[YOUTUBE VIDEO DOWNLOADER ]**:
The YouTube Video Downloader project is a simple yet practical tool I've developed to enable downloading videos from YouTube. With this application, you can input a link to a YouTube video, and the app will download the video to your device. This project represents an exploration of network handling and multimedia content extraction.

## Contributions

I'm just getting started on my journey, and I'm excited to learn and contribute more to the open source community in the future.
